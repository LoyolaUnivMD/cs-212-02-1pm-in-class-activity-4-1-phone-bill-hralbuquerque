THINK before you code...
1: Ask the user which mobile phone package they have(green, blue, or purple).

Green: 49.99 per month for 2GB
  - 15 dollars per extra GB
  - If bill is more than 75, ask if they have a coupon if true take 20 dollars off
  - account for extra GBs; anything greater than 2 GBs

Blue: 70 per month for 4 GB
  - 10 dollers per additional GB

Purple: 99.95 per month for unlimited data

2: Ask the user how much data they used that month

3: create nested if/elif/else statements that can accomplish the following:
  - tell how much they owe for their montly bill
      - do not forget about coupon for the green package
  - note: there is no roll over data

4: if invalid inital user input, print a statement telling them it is an invalid input and to restart the program.
